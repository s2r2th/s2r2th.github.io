            <li>Automated ~70% of treasury and rebalancing workflows and migrated Southeast Asia settlements from traditional fiat rails to on-chain rails, cutting manual effort by ~2 hours/day and reducing all-in settlement costs from ~2.56% to ~0.5% on an eight-digit settlement volume, directly improving exchange P&amp;L.</li>
            <li>Led cross-functional working groups and took operational lead on major initiatives and high-severity incidents, ensuring stable operations while the Director, Crypto Exchange focused on strategy and external stakeholders.</li>

            <li>Supported CySEC and internal audits by documenting and presenting exchange operational controls and custody governance, and contributed to the exchange roadmap for new markets, networks, and custody features by translating operational and resilience constraints into delivery priorities.</li>
            <li>Designed custody topology for exchange hot wallets, treasury, segregated cold custody, and dedicated BCDR workspaces, aligned with internal risk and audit requirements.</li>
            <li>Defined authorisation policies and approval quorum matrices by asset, flow type, and amount band to enforce Segregation of Duties for client withdrawals, internal transfers, ECN settlements, and prime broker margin calls.</li>
            <li>Ran BCDR and disaster-recovery drills with clear RTO and RPO targets and break-glass procedures, and maintained whitelists and policy rules so that withdrawals, settlements, and treasury transfers only used approved internal and external addresses, consistent with exchange-level Travel Rule and compliance checks.</li>
