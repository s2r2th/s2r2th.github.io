            <li>Designed custody topology for exchange hot wallets, treasury, segregated cold custody, and dedicated BCDR workspaces, aligned with internal risk and audit requirements.</li>
            <li>Defined authorisation policies and approval quorum matrices by asset, flow type, and amount band to enforce Segregation of Duties for client withdrawals, internal transfers, ECN settlements, and prime broker margin calls.</li>
            <li>Ran BCDR and disaster-recovery drills with clear RTO and RPO targets and break-glass procedures, and maintained whitelists and policy rules so that withdrawals, settlements, and treasury transfers only used approved internal and external addresses, consistent with exchange-level Travel Rule and compliance checks.</li>
